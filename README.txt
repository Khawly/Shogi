To play, simply click on a piece to display potential moves, and click the 
piece's destination to move. You can click the piece again to hide it's
potential movements. This game was designed for two players only.

We were able to implement most of the rules except for dropping captured
pieces on the board, the promoted bishop's extra movements, and the promoted
Rook's movements. 

We worked on each of the files equally.
